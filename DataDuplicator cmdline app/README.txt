for tutorials and information on how to use this program.

------Setup------
The first thing you need to do is tell the program where your
map is, by putting its path in the "parameters.txt" file.

This version comes with 5 Templates, which you can use:
1) AttachmentTemplate: attaches a single turret to an 
    existing unit.
2) CircleAttachmentTemplate: creates a bunch of turrets,
    arranged in a circle, attached to an existing unit.
    Unfortunately, only one of these turrets actually attacks.
3) HeroTemplate: turns an existing unit into a hero,
    Warcraft 3 style. The hero has three attributes: Strength,
    Agility, and Intelligence, which are adjustable. The hero
    gains experience, can learn abilities, and has a 6-slot
    inventory.
4) PhoenixFireTemplate: creates an item that has the phoenix
    fire ability (from Warcraft 3). Causes the holder to gain
    a weapon which periodically fires at a random nearby
    enemy automatically.
5) TomeOfExperienceTemplate: the simplest template. Creates
    an item which gives the holder experience when used.

To use any of the above templates, go to the Custom Items 
folder and fill out the appropriate csv file.
